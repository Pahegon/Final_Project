# Final_Project

Analysis of world grain (cereal) production in last years


1) Project management (members): Pablo Herranz



2) Goal of the project (BI project): Explain the evolution of grain/cereal production all over the world, determine the production tendency and compare it with the predictions for 2022/2023.



3) Dataset description:
	
	- World grain production (producers, consumer countries, types of grain, prices...). FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations). At this moment around 18 GB of files to clean.

		a) Top producers, top buyers, , grain types, cereals consumption, evolution of prices

		b) Optional: Risk factors for cereal production (leak of pesticides, droughts, natural disasters...) and countries most affected by a reduction in production.
	

	- Prediction of the world grain production. FAO and main word agriculture production websites (web scraping). 



4) Timetable:

	- Wednesday-Sunday: 

          1.- Cleaning Data (Python).

	  2.- DF design/develop (csv files).

	  3.- Importation to MySQL and define the queries that will be used in Tableau (MySQL).

	  4.- Web scraping for getting the world grain prediction for 2022/2023 and DF developing

	
	 - Friday-Wednesday (second week):

	   1.- Tableau Dashboards Design


	 - Wednesday-Thursday:

	   1.- Project presentation.
